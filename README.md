# :construction_worker: Getting Started


**You will need to install the following in order to get this project up & running locally**


* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (this project only currently supports node versions V14 or higher)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)


**Dependency management with Lerna & yarn workspaces** 

The project currently uses [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) to manage dependencies. This project follows a monorepo structure and should be treated as such. This means that when installing new dependencies or bootstraping the project for the first time, you should not run `yarn install` in a given sub-project's directory. Any new dependencies should be directly added to sub-project package.json and you should then run `yarn` in the root directory to install these new dependencies.


**Install Dependencies** 

```
yarn
```

**Setting up environment variables** 

Both the `frontend` and `api` project have a `.env.example` which provides an example of what `.env` variables are required & their type (i.e. string, number etc). If you fail to provide these values, the frontend & api **will fail to start**.

Create your environment variables based on the examples of the relevant `.env.example`

```
cp -r .env.example .env 
```

***Setting up Redis & Postgres*** 

You must install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in order to run Redis & Postgres. Make sure you have filled the environment variables related to Postgres & Redis correctly and then run the following to start Redis & Postgres.

```bash
docker-compose up 
```


Now that the databases are started we can start the API for the first time.

Run the following commands to start the API (ensure the databases are running): 


This command transpiles Typescript to Javascript:

```bash 
yarn watch
```

Open up a new terminal & cd into the `api` folder


Start the API in a development environment:  

```bash
yarn dev 
```

The backend will now be listening on `http://localhost:<PORT>/api/graphql`(migrations are automatically ran if needed)

If you want to seed the database there is a seed available which will seed the local database with 24 users & 24 products. Simply run `yarn seed` in the api folder (with the databases running) in order to seed your local database

**running migrations** 

If you make any changes to the database schema you will need to generate migrations in order to apply your changes to the dataase. 

To create a new migration (in the api project):  

```bash 
yarn migrate:gen
```

To run these migrations against your local database (in the api project): 

```bash 
yarn migrate:up 
```

To revert these changes & rollback the migration: 

```bash 
yarn migrate:down 
```


# :postbox: FAQ 

**Question** What tech is used in this Project? 

**Answer:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Apollo server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/), [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/), [Redis](https://redis.io/), [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-gb-de), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

**Question** Why use GraphQL & not REST? 

**Answer:** While I could've chosen to write this API purely in a RESTful manner, this would've extended the amount of time spent on this project significantly. This project uses GraphQL codegen which significatlly cut down the amount of development & testing resource it would've taken to manually write hooks & manage state.
